# Simple Wasm Test

Learn how to build a WASM library using RUST calling C code. The WASM-pack tool was used

## 🚴 Usage

### 🐑 Use `cargo generate` to Clone this Template

[Learn more about `cargo generate` here.](https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/cargo-generate)

```
cargo generate --git https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack-template.git --name my-project
cd my-project
```

### 🛠️ Build with `wasm-pack build`

```
wasm-pack build
```

### 🔬 Test in Headless Browsers with `wasm-pack test`

```
wasm-pack test --headless --firefox
```

### 🎁 Publish to NPM with `wasm-pack publish`

```
wasm-pack publish
```

## 🔋 Batteries Included

* [`wasm-bindgen`](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen) for communicating
  between WebAssembly and JavaScript.
* [`console_error_panic_hook`](https://github.com/rustwasm/console_error_panic_hook)
  for logging panic messages to the developer console.
* [`wee_alloc`](https://github.com/rustwasm/wee_alloc), an allocator optimized
  for small code size.



## commands
```
# build by wasm-pack,  this need set crate-type = ["cdylib", "rlib"] in cargo.toml
wasm-pack build --target web  

# build by raw
cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown

# wasm to wat format
